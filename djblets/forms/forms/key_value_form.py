"""A form for working with key/value stores."""

class KeyValueForm(forms.Form):
    """A form for working with key/value stores.

    Typical forms are built to work either with database models or with
    entirely custom objects, but are less useful when working with
    dictionaries, caches, generic object attributes, or other objects that work
    as key/value stores.

    This form provides a standard way of loading fields from a key/value
    store and saving back out to one.

    By default, it assumes it's working with something that behaves like a
    dictionary (containing a ``get()`` method and a ``__getitem__`` operator).
    This can be overridden by providing implementations of
    :py:meth:`get_key_value` and :py:meth:`set_key_value`.

    Values for specific keys can be specially serialized/deserialized by
    providing :samp:`serialize_{keyname}_field()` and
    :samp:`deserialize_{keyname}_field()` functions. These take a value and are
    expected to return a serializable JSON value or a deserialized value,
    respectively.

    It's also makes it easy to implement saving behavior for the object
    by overriding :py:meth:`save_instance`.

    There's support for dynamically marking fields as disabled and specifying
    the reason it's disabled, for display in the form. This can be done by
    setting :py:attr:`disabled_fields` and :py:attr:`disabled_reasons`, and
    using the latter in a template.

    Fields can be blacklisted from loading or saving by setting
    :py:attr:`Meta.load_blacklist` and :py:attr:`Meta.save_blacklist`,
    respectively to a list or tuple of field names. Unless specified otherwise,
    the loading blacklist will default to the same fields in the save
    blacklist.

    Args:
        disabled_fields (dict):
            A dictionary of field names to booleans indicating fields that
            should be disabled (if their values are set to ``True``). Those
            fields will then be disabled in the HTML (by setting the
            ``disabled`` attribute on the field).

        disabled_reasons (dict):
            A dictionary of field names to strings describing the reason a
            particular field is disabled. These are not required, and are
            not automatically outputted in any form, but may be useful to
            templates.

        instance (object):
            The instance being loaded and saved. This can be ``None`` (the
            default) when not yet working on an instance (but in that case,
            :py:meth:`create_instance` must be defined).

    Example:
        With custom field serialization:

        .. code-block:: python

            class MyForm(KeyValueForm):
                book = forms.ModelChoiceField(queryset=Book.objects.all())

                def serialize_book_field(self, value):
                    return {
                        'id': book.pk,
                        'title': book.title,
                    }

                def deserialize_book_field(self, value):
                    return Book.objects.get(pk=value['id'])
