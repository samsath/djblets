"""Context processors for serial numbers used for front-end caching.

These context processors can be used to inject the :setting:`MEDIA_SERIAL`
and :setting:`AJAX_SERIAL` settings into templates so that links can be
built that take these caching serials into account.

See :py:mod:`djblets.cache.serials` for more information on building these
serials.
