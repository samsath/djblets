class GenerationSynchronizer(object):
    """Manages the synchronization of generation state across processes.

    This is a utility class that makes it easy for consumers to synchronize
    a generation ID between processes and servers. This ID can be used to
    check whether a process has the latest version of some data, updating
    if the version it has is expired.

    Callers should create a :py:class:`GenerationSynchronizer` with a stable
    cache key, which will be used for communication between processes/servers.
    The initial generation number will be fetched, or created if one does not
    already exist.

    When the caller has updated something in the state, it must call
    :py:meth:`mark_updated`. This will bump the synchronization generation
    number, which will invalidate other processes.

    Other callers, upon noticing that their state is expired (through
    :py:meth:`is_expired`) can re-fetch or re-compute the data needed and
    then call :py:meth:`refresh` to refresh the instance's counter from the
    cache.

    Attributes:
        sync_gen (int):
            The synchronization generation number last fetched or set by
            this instance.

        cache_key (unicode):
            The synchronization cache key.
