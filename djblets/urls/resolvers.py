    A standard RegexURLResolver expects that a list of URL patterns will
    be set once and never again change. In most applications, this is a
    good assumption. However, some that are more specialized may need
    to be able to swap in URL patterns dynamically. For example, those
    that can plug in third-party extensions.

    DynamicURLResolver makes it easy to add and remove URL patterns. Any
    time the list of URL patterns changes, they'll be immediately available
    for all URL resolution and reversing.

    The usage is very simple::

        dynamic_patterns = DynamicURLResolver()
        urlpatterns = [dynamic_patterns]

        dynamic_patterns.add_patterns([
            url(...),
            url(...),
        ])

    DynamicURLResolver will handle managing all the lookup caches to ensure
    that there won't be any stale entries affecting any dynamic URL patterns.
