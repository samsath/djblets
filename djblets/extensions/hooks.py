"""Base support and implementations for extension hooks.

Extension hooks allow applications to define formal ways to inject logic,
behavior, or more into part of the application.

This module provides the base support for defining an extension hook, through
:py:class:`ExtensionHook` and :py:class:`ExtensionHookPoint`, along with
a utility mixin, :py:class:`AppliesToURLMixin`.

It also provides some built-in hooks for applications and extensions to use:

* :py:class:`DataGridColumnsHook`
* :py:class:`SignalHook`
* :py:class:`TemplateHook`
* :py:class:`URLHook`

    """The base class for a hook into some part of an application.

    ExtensionHooks are classes that can hook into an
    :py:class:`ExtensionHookPoint` to provide some level of functionality in an
    application. A consuming application should provide a subclass of
    ExtensionHook that will provide functions for getting data or anything else
    that's needed. Extensions may then subclass or initialize that specific
    ExtensionHook.

    A base ExtensionHook subclass must use :py:class:`ExtensionHookPoint`
    as a metaclass. All hooks deriving from that subclass will be registered
    along with that hook point.

    Example:
        .. code-block:: python

           from django.utils import six

       Starting with Djblets 0.10, extension hooks should implement the
       :py:meth:`initialize` method to handle any initialization. It no longer
       needs to call the parent :py:meth:`shutdown` method, either. However,
       to retain compatibility with older versions, they may still override
       :py:meth:`__init__` and may call the parent :py:meth:`shutdown`. See
       those methods for more details.
