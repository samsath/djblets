    Objects using this mixin can have a dynamic list of forms, which can be

    can be removed. With this mixin, it is possible to extend a configuration
    page, allowing each form to load, validate, and save without the page
    hard-coding support for each form.

    attribute to an instance of
    :py:class:`~djblets.configforms.registry.ConfigPageRegistry`.

    To manage the forms on a page, the :py:meth:`add_form` and
